# Day 19: File Handling – Managing AI Datasets and Logs
# Working with JSON files for configurations and TXT files for activity tracking.

import json
import os

# 1. Simulating a JSON-style configuration (commonly used for model settings)
model_config = {
    "model_name": "Resilient_NLP_v1",
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "epochs": 50,
    "status": "ready"
}

# 2. WRITING: Store the configuration in a .json file
with open("config.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(model_config, f, indent=4)
    print("✅ Configuration written to config.json")

# 3. READING: Reload the configuration from the file
if os.path.exists("config.json"):
    with open("config.json", "r") as f:
        loaded_data = json.load(f)
        print(f"📂 Model Loaded: {loaded_data['model_name']}")

# 4. APPENDING: Record the event in a .txt log file
with open("training_logs.txt", "a") as log_file:
    log_file.write(f"Model {model_config['model_name']} loaded with status {model_config['status']}\n")
    print("📝 Entry added to training_logs.txt")
