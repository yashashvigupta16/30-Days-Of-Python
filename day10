# Day 10: Loops – Simulating AI Model Training Cycles
# Loops help automate repeated processes such as training iterations.

# 1. Simulating a Training Process (for loop)
print("🚀 Initiating Model Training...")
accuracies = [0.65, 0.72, 0.78, 0.85, 0.91]

# In Machine Learning, one complete pass through the dataset is called an 'Epoch'
for epoch, acc in enumerate(accuracies, 1):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Accuracy = {acc * 100}%")

# 2. Tracking Loss Reduction (while loop)
