# 30 Days of Python Challenge 🐍

I am participating in the [30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) challenge by Asabeneh. This repository serves as a diary of my progress, code snippets, and projects as I master Python from the ground up.

## 🚀 My Goal
My objective is to build a strong foundation in Python to transition into Data Analysis.

## 📅 Progress Tracker
| Day | Topic | Key Project/Script | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Day 01 | Introduction & Variables | `hello_world.py` | ✅ Complete |
| Day 02 | Built-in Functions | `variables.py` | 🏃 In Progress |

## 🛠️ Skills I'm Building
- **Core:** Data Types, Loops, Functions
- **Advanced:** File Handling, Regular Expressions, Web Scraping
