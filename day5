# Day 5: Lists – Handling an AI Model Dataset
# In machine learning, lists are commonly used to store and evaluate model performance metrics.

# 1. Creating a List (A collection of accuracy scores)
model_accuracies = [0.85, 0.92, 0.78, 0.95, 0.88]

# 2. Adding new data (A newly trained model is added)
model_accuracies.append(0.91)

# 3. Updating data (Correcting an incorrectly recorded score)
model_accuracies[2] = 0.80  # Updating 0.78 to 0.80

# 4. Using List Methods for Evaluation
model_accuracies.sort(reverse=True)  # Arrange scores from highest to lowest
best_score = model_accuracies[0]
worst_score = model_accuracies[-1]

# 5. Selecting the Top 3 Performing Models
top_3_models = model_accuracies[:3]

print(f"Complete Dataset: {model_accuracies}")
print(f"Best Performing Model: {best_score}")
print(f"Top 3 Models Ready for Deployment: {top_3_models}")
