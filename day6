# Day 6: Tuples – Managing Immutable Model Configurations
# Tuples are ideal for storing values that should remain unchanged throughout execution.

# 1. Defining Model Hyperparameters (Fixed Configuration)
# (Learning_Rate, Batch_Size, Optimizer)
model_config = (0.001, 32, "Adam")

# 2. Saving Input Dimensions (Height, Width, Channels)
# Commonly used in Computer Vision applications
input_shape = (224, 224, 3)

# 3. Accessing Tuple Values
print(f"Selected Optimizer: {model_config[2]}")
print(f"Input Resolution: {input_shape[0]}x{input_shape[1]}")

# 4. Trying to modify a tuple (Uncomment to observe the error)
# input_shape[0] = 128  # This will raise a TypeError
