# Day 22: Web Scraping – Creating Custom Datasets
# Using BeautifulSoup to collect structured data from web pages.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# 1. Practice URL (A safe and publicly accessible site for scraping)
url = 'https://archive.org/details/texts'

try:
    # 2. Request the web page
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    # 3. Parse the returned HTML
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    # 4. Data extraction: Locate all collection entries
    # Logic: Identify elements by tag and class name
    titles = soup.find_all('div', class_='item-ia')
    
    print(f"🔎 Scraping completed successfully! Total items found: {len(titles)}\n")
    
    for i, item in enumerate(titles[:5], 1):
        # Extract and clean the text content
        title_text = item.get_text().strip()
        print(f"{i}. {title_text}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ An error occurred during scraping: {e}")
